SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief \\nAct of 2001''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 \\n        European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and \\n        communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one \\n        of the most tragic crimes in modern history.\\n            (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \\n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \\n        many were rejected because the claimants did not have death \\n        certificates or physical possession of policy documents that \\n        had been confiscated by the Nazis.\\n            (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the \\n        only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging to \\n        Holocaust victims.\\n            (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been \\n        fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to settle \\n        unpaid insurance claims.\\n            (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \\n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \\n        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \\n        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \\n        insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of \\n        international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, to \\n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \\n        issued to Holocaust victims.\\n            (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \\n        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \\n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \\n        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that were \\n        not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.\\n            (7) The ICHEIC's deadline for receiving claims applications \\n        is January 31, 2002.\\n            (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of \\n        unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold \\n        thousands of names on dormant accounts.\\n            (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 \\n        claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle because \\n        the claimants could not identify the company holding the \\n        policy.\\n            (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United \\n        States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of \\n        insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their \\n        related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid \\n        resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to \\n        eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and their \\n        families.\\n            (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, \\n        Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in \\n        efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of insurers \\n        to engage in business transactions in those States until the \\n        insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era policyholders.\\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide information \\nabout Holocaust-era insurance policies to Holocaust victims and their \\nheirs and beneficiaries to enable them to expeditiously file their \\nrightful claims under the policies.\\n\\nSEC. 3. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY.\\n\\n    (a) Establishment and Maintenance.--Chapter 21 of title 44, United \\nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\\n``Sec. 2119. Holocaust Insurance Registry\\n    ``(a) Establishment.--The Archivist shall establish and maintain a \\ncollection of records that shall--\\n            ``(1) be known as the Holocaust Insurance Registry; and\\n            ``(2) consist of the information provided to the Archivist \\n        under section 5 of the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act \\n        of 2001.\\n    ``(b) Public Accessibility.--The Archivist shall make all such \\ninformation publicly accessible and searchable by means of the Internet \\nand by any other means the Archivist deems appropriate.''.\\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \\nchapter 21 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \\nend the following:\\n\\n``2119. Holocaust Insurance Registry.''.\\n\\nSEC. 4. FULL DISCLOSURE OF HOLOCAUST-ERA POLICIES BY INSURERS.\\n\\n    (a) Requirement.--An insurer shall cause to be filed with the \\nSecretary of Commerce in accordance with subsection (b) the following \\ninformation:\\n            (1) The first name, last name, date of birth, and domicile \\n        of the policyholder of each covered policy issued by the \\n        insurer or a related company of the insurer.\\n            (2) The name of the entity that issued the covered policy.\\n            (3) The name of the entity that is responsible for the \\n        liabilities of the entity that issued the covered policy.\\n    (b) Proper Filing.--A filing under subsection (a) shall be made not \\nlater than the earlier of 90 days after the date of the enactment of \\nthis Act or January 31, 2002, in an electronic format approved jointly \\nby the Archivist of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce.\\n\\nSEC. 5. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO ARCHIVIST.\\n\\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall provide to the Archivist of the \\nUnited States any information filed with the Secretary under section \\n4(a) promptly after the filing of such information.\\n\\nSEC. 6. PENALTY.\\n\\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall assess a civil penalty of not less \\nthan $5,000 for each day that an insurer fails to comply with the \\nrequirements of section 4, as determined by the Secretary.\\n\\nSEC. 7. USE OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS CIVIL PENALTIES.\\n\\n    To the extent or in the amounts provided in advance in \\nappropriation Acts, the Archivist of the United States may use amounts \\nreceived by the Government as civil penalties under section 6 to \\nmaintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry.\\n\\nSEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\\n\\n    (a) Initial Notification.--Not later than 180 days after the date \\nof the enactment of this Act and periodically afterward, the Secretary \\nof Commerce shall notify each State's commissioner of insurance of the \\nidentity of each insurer that has failed to comply with the \\nrequirements of section 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for \\nwhich the insurer is liable under section 6.\\n    (b) Requests by States.--On request by the commissioner of \\ninsurance of a State concerning an insurer operating in that State, the \\nSecretary of Commerce shall inform the commissioner of insurance \\nwhether the insurer has failed to comply with the requirements of \\nsection 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for which the insurer \\nis liable under section 6.\\n\\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES.\\n\\n    (a) Preemption.--Nothing in this Act preempts the right of any \\nState to adopt or enforce any State law requiring an insurer to \\ndisclose information regarding insurance policies that may have been \\nconfiscated or stolen from victims of Nazi persecution.\\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that if any \\nlitigation challenging any State law described in subsection (a) is \\ndismissed because the State's commissioner of insurance chooses to rely \\non this Act and therefore no longer seeks to enforce the State law, \\neach party should bear its own legal fees and costs.\\n\\nSEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Commissioner of insurance.--The term ``commissioner of \\n        insurance'' means the highest ranking officer of a State \\n        responsible for regulating insurance.\\n            (2) Covered policy.--The term ``covered policy'' means any \\n        life, dowry, education, or property insurance policy that was--\\n                    (A) in effect at any time after January 30, 1933, \\n                and before December 31, 1945; and\\n                    (B) issued to a policyholder domiciled in any area \\n                of the European Continent that was occupied or \\n                controlled by Nazi Germany or by any ally or \\n                sympathizer of Nazi Germany at any time during the \\n                period described in subparagraph (A).\\n            (3) Insurer.--The term ``insurer'' means any person engaged \\n        in the business of insurance in United States interstate or \\n        foreign commerce, if the person or a related company of the \\n        person issued a covered policy, regardless of when the related \\n        company became a related company of the insurer.\\n            (4) Related company.--The term ``related company'' means an \\n        affiliate, as that term is defined in section 104(g) of the \\n        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\"}\n",

The \\n        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill \\n        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and \\n        protection in the Constitution.\\n            (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents \\n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are \\n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \\n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \\n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \\n        citizens of the United States.\\n            (3) The United States will continue to receive requests \\n        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human \\n        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. \\n        In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish \\n        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the \\n        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. \\n        Currently, the United States responds to declassification \\n        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential \\n        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of \\n        the United States in the protection and promotion of human \\n        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant \\n        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, \\n        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \\n        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').\\n            (4) The expedient declassification of human rights \\n        documents in full compliance with United States security \\n        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will \\n        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law \\n        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of \\n        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of \\n        Government resources.\\n            (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \\n        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States \\n        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military \\n        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, \\n        consistent with the national interests and international \\n        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless \\n        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and \\n        citizens of the United States promote human rights and \\n        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if \\n        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken \\n        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed \\n        United States engagements in those areas remains.\\n            (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \\n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \\n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \\n        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a \\n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \\n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \\n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \\n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.\\n            (7) The United States has long provided international \\n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \\n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \\n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \\n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \\n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \\n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\\n            (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against \\n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \\nPunishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one \\nanother the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \\nproceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or \\ncomplicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at \\ntheir disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a \\nmember State of the Organization of American States, the United States \\nshould seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the \\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the \\nOrganization of American States adopt legislative and such other \\nmeasures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to \\ninformation in files and documents in the power of the State, \\nparticularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal \\nresponsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human \\nrights.''\\n            (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \\n        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and \\n        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission \\n        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and \\n        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \\n        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \\n        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, \\n        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human \\n        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the \\n        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification \\n        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal \\n        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan \\n        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, \\n        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the \\n        relatives.''\\n            (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, \\n        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery \\n        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the \\n        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.\\n            (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, \\n        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I \\n        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence \\n        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the \\n        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] \\n        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. \\n        We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace \\n        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''\\n            (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \\n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting \\n        documentation of the United States on human rights violations \\n        in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \\n        has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \\n        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \\n        United States Government containing information about gross \\n        violations of internationally recognized human rights committed \\n        after 1944.\\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \\n        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \\n        policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, \\n        the Department of State, the Agency for International \\n        Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its \\n        components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \\n        Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of \\n        its components), the National Security Council, and the \\n        Executive Office of the President.\\n            (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human \\n        rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally \\n        recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in \\n        section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \\n        U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).\\n\\nSEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS \\n              RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \\nprovisions of this Act shall govern the declassification and public \\ndisclosure of human rights records by agencies.\\n    (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the \\ndate of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and \\norganize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in \\nGuatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and \\ndisclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, \\nall records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available \\nto the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section \\nis completed.\\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of \\nenactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding \\neach agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.\\n\\nSEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a \\nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \\nonly if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing \\nevidence that--\\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \\n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \\n        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \\n        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \\n        such public disclosure would reveal--\\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently \\n                requires protection;\\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \\n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \\n                        Government;\\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \\n                        disclosed; and\\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \\n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \\n                        activities; or\\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \\n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \\n                of foreign relations of the United States, the \\n                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the \\n                national security of the \\n                United States;\\n            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided \\n        confidential information to the United States and would pose a \\n        substantial risk of harm to that individual;\\n            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \\n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \\n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \\n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\\n            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \\n        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a \\n        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public \\n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \\n        interest.\\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \\ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \\nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \\nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \\nrelationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection \\n(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an \\n``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \\n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\\n\\nSEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN \\n              OTHER COUNTRIES.\\n\\n    In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request \\nfor human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations, \\nthe Organization of American States or a similar entity, a national \\ntruth commission or entity of similar nature, or from the principal \\njustice or human rights official of a country that is investigating a \\npattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, \\nthe agency shall conduct a review of records as described in section 4 \\nand shall declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance \\nwith the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.\\n\\nSEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS.\\n\\n    (a) Duties of the Appeals Panel.--The Interagency Security \\nClassification Appeals Panel or any other entity subsequently \\nestablished by law or Executive order and charged with carrying out the \\nfunctions currently carried out by such Panel (referred to in this Act \\nas the ``Appeals Panel'') shall review all determinations by an agency \\nto postpone public disclosure of any human rights record.\\n    (b) Determinations of the Appeals Panel.--\\n            (1) In general.--The Appeals Panel shall direct that all \\n        human rights records be disclosed to the public, unless the \\n        Appeals Panel determines that there is clear and convincing \\n        evidence that--\\n                    (A) the record is not a human rights record; or\\n                    (B) the human rights record or particular \\n                information in the human rights record qualifies for \\n                postponement of disclosure pursuant to section 5.\\n            (2) Treatment in cases of nondisclosure.--If the Appeals \\n        Panel concurs with an agency decision to postpone disclosure of \\n        a human rights record, the Appeals Panel shall determine, in \\n        consultation with the originating agency and consistent with \\nthe standards set forth in this Act, which, if any, of the alternative \\nforms of disclosure described in paragraph (3) shall be made by the \\nagency.\\n            (3) Alternative forms of disclosure.--The forms of \\n        disclosure described in this paragraph are as follows:\\n                    (A) Disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion \\n                of the human rights record after deletion of the \\n                portions described in paragraph (1).\\n                    (B) Disclosure of a record that is a substitute for \\n                information which is not disclosed.\\n                    (C) Disclosure of a summary of the information \\n                contained in the human rights record.\\n            (4) Notification of determination.--\\n                    (A) In general.--Upon completion of its review, the \\n                Appeals Panel shall notify the head of the agency in \\n                control or possession of the human rights record that \\n                was the subject of the review of its determination and \\n                shall, not later than 14 days after the determination, \\n                publish the determination in the Federal Register.\\n                    (B) Notice to president.--The Appeals Panel shall \\n                notify the President of its determination.

The short- and long-term \\n        consequences of untreated childhood mental disorders are \\n        costly, in both human and fiscal terms.\\n            ``(2) School counselors, school social workers, and school \\n        psychologists are needed to help these children and to provide \\n        a variety of crucial support services.\\n            ``(3) Across the United States, there are insufficient \\n        resources for school-based counseling professionals, and often \\n        students do not get the help they need. The current national \\n        average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary \\n        and secondary schools is 561 to 1.\\n            ``(4) United States schools need more mental health \\n        professionals, and they need the flexibility to hire the \\n        professionals that will best serve their students.\\n            ``(5) According to the Institute of Medicine of the \\n        National Academy of Sciences, the maximum recommended ratio \\n        of--\\n                    ``(A) students to school counselors is 250 to 1;\\n                    ``(B) students to school psychologists is 1,000 to \\n                1; and\\n                    ``(C) students to school social workers is 800 to \\n                1.\\n            ``(6) In some States, 1 school counselor typically serves \\n        over 1,000 students.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief \\nAct of 2001''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 \\n        European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and \\n        communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one \\n        of the most tragic crimes in modern history.\\n            (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \\n        presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \\n        many were rejected because the claimants did not have death \\n        certificates or physical possession of policy documents that \\n        had been confiscated by the Nazis.\\n            (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the \\n        only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging to \\n        Holocaust victims.\\n            (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been \\n        fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to settle \\n        unpaid insurance claims.\\n            (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \\n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \\n        ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \\n        Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \\n        insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of \\n        international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, to \\n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \\n        issued to Holocaust victims.\\n            (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \\n        an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \\n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \\n        designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that were \\n        not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.\\n            (7) The ICHEIC's deadline for receiving claims applications \\n        is January 31, 2002.\\n            (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of \\n        unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold \\n        thousands of names on dormant accounts.\\n            (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 \\n        claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle because \\n        the claimants could not identify the company holding the \\n        policy.\\n            (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United \\n        States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of \\n        insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their \\n        related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid \\n        resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to \\n        eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and their \\n        families.\\n            (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, \\n        Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in \\n        efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of insurers \\n        to engage in business transactions in those States until the \\n        insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era policyholders.\\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide information \\nabout Holocaust-era insurance policies to Holocaust victims and their \\nheirs and beneficiaries to enable them to expeditiously file their \\nrightful claims under the policies.\\n\\nSEC. 3. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY.\\n\\n    (a) Establishment and Maintenance.--Chapter 21 of title 44, United \\nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\\n``Sec. 2119. Holocaust Insurance Registry\\n    ``(a) Establishment.--The Archivist shall establish and maintain a \\ncollection of records that shall--\\n            ``(1) be known as the Holocaust Insurance Registry; and\\n            ``(2) consist of the information provided to the Archivist \\n        under section 5 of the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act \\n        of 2001.\\n    ``(b) Public Accessibility.--The Archivist shall make all such \\ninformation publicly accessible and searchable by means of the Internet \\nand by any other means the Archivist deems appropriate.''.\\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \\nchapter 21 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \\nend the following:\\n\\n``2119. Holocaust Insurance Registry.''.\\n\\nSEC. 4. FULL DISCLOSURE OF HOLOCAUST-ERA POLICIES BY INSURERS.\\n\\n    (a) Requirement.--An insurer shall cause to be filed with the \\nSecretary of Commerce in accordance with subsection (b) the following \\ninformation:\\n            (1) The first name, last name, date of birth, and domicile \\n        of the policyholder of each covered policy issued by the \\n        insurer or a related company of the insurer.\\n            (2) The name of the entity that issued the covered policy.\\n            (3) The name of the entity that is responsible for the \\n        liabilities of the entity that issued the covered policy.\\n    (b) Proper Filing.--A filing under subsection (a) shall be made not \\nlater than the earlier of 90 days after the date of the enactment of \\nthis Act or January 31, 2002, in an electronic format approved jointly \\nby the Archivist of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce.\\n\\nSEC. 5. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO ARCHIVIST.\\n\\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall provide to the Archivist of the \\nUnited States any information filed with the Secretary under section \\n4(a) promptly after the filing of such information.\\n\\nSEC. 6. PENALTY.\\n\\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall assess a civil penalty of not less \\nthan $5,000 for each day that an insurer fails to comply with the \\nrequirements of section 4, as determined by the Secretary.\\n\\nSEC. 7. USE OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS CIVIL PENALTIES.\\n\\n    To the extent or in the amounts provided in advance in \\nappropriation Acts, the Archivist of the United States may use amounts \\nreceived by the Government as civil penalties under section 6 to \\nmaintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry.\\n\\nSEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\\n\\n    (a) Initial Notification.--Not later than 180 days after the date \\nof the enactment of this Act and periodically afterward, the Secretary \\nof Commerce shall notify each State's commissioner of insurance of the \\nidentity of each insurer that has failed to comply with the \\nrequirements of section 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for \\nwhich the insurer is liable under section 6.\\n    (b) Requests by States.--On request by the commissioner of \\ninsurance of a State concerning an insurer operating in that State, the \\nSecretary of Commerce shall inform the commissioner of insurance \\nwhether the insurer has failed to comply with the requirements of \\nsection 4 or has not satisfied any civil penalty for which the insurer \\nis liable under section 6.\\n\\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES.\\n\\n    (a) Preemption.--Nothing in this Act preempts the right of any \\nState to adopt or enforce any State law requiring an insurer to \\ndisclose information regarding insurance policies that may have been \\nconfiscated or stolen from victims of Nazi persecution.\\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that if any \\nlitigation challenging any State law described in subsection (a) is \\ndismissed because the State's commissioner of insurance chooses to rely \\non this Act and therefore no longer seeks to enforce the State law, \\neach party should bear its own legal fees and costs.\\n\\nSEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Commissioner of insurance.--The term ``commissioner of \\n        insurance'' means the highest ranking officer of a State \\n        responsible for regulating insurance.\\n            (2) Covered policy.--The term ``covered policy'' means any \\n        life, dowry, education, or property insurance policy that was--\\n                    (A) in effect at any time after January 30, 1933, \\n                and before December 31, 1945; and\\n                    (B) issued to a policyholder domiciled in any area \\n                of the European Continent that was occupied or \\n                controlled by Nazi Germany or by any ally or \\n                sympathizer of Nazi Germany at any time during the \\n                period described in subparagraph (A).\\n            (3) Insurer.--The term ``insurer'' means any person engaged \\n        in the business of insurance in United States interstate or \\n        foreign commerce, if the person or a related company of the \\n        person issued a covered policy, regardless of when the related \\n        company became a related company of the insurer.\\n            (4) Related company.--The term ``related company'' means an \\n        affiliate, as that term is defined in section 104(g) of the \\n        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\"}\n",

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The people of the United States consider the national \\n        and international protection and promotion of human rights and \\n        the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The \\n        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill \\n        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and \\n        protection in the Constitution.\\n            (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents \\n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are \\n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \\n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \\n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \\n        citizens of the United States.\\n            (3) The United States will continue to receive requests \\n        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human \\n        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. \\n        In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish \\n        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the \\n        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. \\n        Currently, the United States responds to declassification \\n        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential \\n        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of \\n        the United States in the protection and promotion of human \\n        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant \\n        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, \\n        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \\n        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').\\n            (4) The expedient declassification of human rights \\n        documents in full compliance with United States security \\n        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will \\n        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law \\n        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of \\n        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of \\n        Government resources.\\n            (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \\n        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States \\n        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military \\n        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, \\n        consistent with the national interests and international \\n        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless \\n        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and \\n        citizens of the United States promote human rights and \\n        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if \\n        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken \\n        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed \\n        United States engagements in those areas remains.\\n            (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \\n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \\n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \\n        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a \\n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \\n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \\n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \\n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.\\n            (7) The United States has long provided international \\n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \\n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \\n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \\n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \\n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \\n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\\n            (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against \\n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \\nPunishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one \\nanother the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \\nproceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or \\ncomplicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at \\ntheir disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a \\nmember State of the Organization of American States, the United States \\nshould seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the \\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the \\nOrganization of American States adopt legislative and such other \\nmeasures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to \\ninformation in files and documents in the power of the State, \\nparticularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal \\nresponsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human \\nrights.''\\n            (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \\n        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and \\n        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission \\n        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and \\n        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \\n        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \\n        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, \\n        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human \\n        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the \\n        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification \\n        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal \\n        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan \\n        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, \\n        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the \\n        relatives.''\\n            (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, \\n        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery \\n        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the \\n        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.\\n            (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, \\n        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I \\n        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence \\n        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the \\n        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] \\n        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. \\n        We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace \\n        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''\\n            (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \\n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting \\n        documentation of the United States on human rights violations \\n        in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \\n        has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \\n        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \\n        United States Government containing information about gross \\n        violations of internationally recognized human rights committed \\n        after 1944.\\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \\n        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \\n        policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, \\n        the Department of State, the Agency for International \\n        Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its \\n        components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \\n        Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of \\n        its components), the National Security Council, and the \\n        Executive Office of the President.\\n            (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human \\n        rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally \\n        recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in \\n        section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \\n        U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).\\n\\nSEC. 4.

GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a \\nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \\nonly if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing \\nevidence that--\\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \\n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \\n        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \\n        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \\n        such public disclosure would reveal--\\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently \\n                requires protection;\\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \\n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \\n                        Government;\\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \\n                        disclosed; and\\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \\n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \\n                        activities; or\\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \\n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \\n                of foreign relations of the United States, the \\n                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the \\n                national security of the \\n                United States;\\n            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided \\n        confidential information to the United States and would pose a \\n        substantial risk of harm to that individual;\\n            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \\n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \\n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \\n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\\n            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \\n        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a \\n        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public \\n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \\n        interest.\\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \\ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \\nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \\nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \\nrelationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection \\n(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an \\n``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \\n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\\n\\nSEC. 6.

The short- and long-term \\n        consequences of untreated childhood mental disorders are \\n        costly, in both human and fiscal terms.\\n            ``(2) School counselors, school social workers, and school \\n        psychologists are needed to help these children and to provide \\n        a variety of crucial support services.\\n            ``(3) Across the United States, there are insufficient \\n        resources for school-based counseling professionals, and often \\n        students do not get the help they need.
